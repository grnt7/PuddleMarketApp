Steps to Open the Project we need to set up an environment that Django can work in. 
To create the environment from the main Project folder use the following command: python3 -m venv env. Creates a virtual environment called env. Its a special environment where you can install packages like Django.
Firstly the project "Puddle" needs to run in a virtual environment .env. Use the following powershell script for windows to activate the environment.
.\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1 

Install Django : pip install django
To start a django project: django-admin startproject [puddle]/[name of project]

Run the django developmnet server using the following command: python manage.py runserver

Now you can open the development server with the address given.

We are now ready to start new Django app, use this command: python manage.py startapp core:
This will now create a new folder with a few files.

Migrations: Information about the database generated by django
admin.py: Where we register the database models to be used inside the django admin interface.
apps.py: a configuration file for this specific app.
models.py: where we define the database models like information about what we want to store for an item (example; the title, description, price and similar.)
tests.py: Where we can run automated tests and similar for this app.
views.py: Where we define the views for the app.

# Puddle - Online Marketplace Project

A simple online marketplace application built with Django, where users can buy and sell new and used items. This project serves as a comprehensive guide to setting up a modern web application using the Django web framework.

## ⚙️ Getting Started: Step-by-Step Setup

The following steps cover the project setup, initial application creation, navigation structure, and database model definition.

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Initial App (`core`)

This phase sets up the development environment and the main project structure.

1.  **Environment Setup**
    
      * Create a Python virtual environment:
        ``` bash
        python -m venv env
        
        ```
      * Activate the environment:
        ``` bash
        source env/bin/activate
        
        ```
      * Install the Django framework:
        ``` bash
        pip install Django
        
        ```

2.  **Create Django Project**
    
      * Start the main project structure (named `puddle`):
        ``` bash
        django-admin startproject puddle
        
        ```
      * Verify the installation by running the development server:
        ``` bash
        python manage.py runserver
        
        ```

3.  **Create `core` App**
    
      * Create the first Django app for general pages:
        ``` bash
        python manage.py startapp core
        
        ```
      * Register the new app by adding `'core'` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in `puddle/settings.py`.

4.  **Define Views and URLs (Index)**
    
      * Create an `index` view function in `core/views.py`.
      * Map the root URL (`/`) to the `index` view in the project's URL file (`puddle/urls.py`).

### Phase 2: Templates and Navigation

This phase establishes the foundational template structure for the entire application.

1.  **Create Base Template (`base.html`)**
    
      * Create the template structure in `core/templates/core/base.html`.
      * Include common elements like the HTML head, Tailwind CDN link, navigation bar, and footer.
      * Utilize **Template Inheritance Blocks** (`{% block title %}` and `{% block content %}`) for child templates.

2.  **Create Index Template (`index.html`)**
    
      * Set up `core/templates/core/index.html` to **extend** the base template (`{% extends 'core/base.html' %}`).
      * Insert page-specific content into the blocks defined in `base.html`.

3.  **Create Contact Page**
    
      * Create a `contact` view function in `core/views.py`.
      * Create the corresponding `contact.html` template.
      * Add a URL pattern for the contact page (`/contact/`) in `puddle/urls.py`, with `name='contact'`.
      * Update the footer in `base.html` to use the Django template tag `{% url 'contact' %}` for the contact link.

### Phase 3: Database Models and Admin (`item` App)

This phase introduces the database structure for the marketplace functionality.

1.  **Create `item` App and Register**
    
      * Create a second app for marketplace-specific data:
        ``` bash
        python manage.py startapp item
        
        ```
      * Register `'item'` in `puddle/settings.py` under `INSTALLED_APPS`.

2.  **Define `Category` Model**
    
      * Define the `Category` model in `item/models.py` with a `name` field (`CharField`).
      * Add `class Meta` for `verbose_name_plural` and ordering.
      * Define the `__str__` method to return `self.name`.

3.  **Define `Item` Model**
    
      * Define the `Item` model in `item/models.py` including fields for:
          * `name`
          * `description` (`TextField`)
          * `price` (`FloatField`)
          * `is_sold` (`BooleanField`)
          * `created_at` (`DateTimeField` with `auto_now_add=True`)
          * **Foreign Keys** to `User` (for `created_by`) and `Category` (for `category`).
      * *Note: Import the built-in `User` model from `django.contrib.auth.models`.*

4.  **Run Migrations**
    
      * Create model migration files:
        ``` bash
        python manage.py makemigrations
        
        ```
      * Apply the migrations to the database:
        ``` bash
        python manage.py migrate
        
        ```

5.  **Set up Admin and Users**
    
      * Create an administrative user:
        ``` bash
        python manage.py createsuperuser
        
        ```
      * Register the `Category` model in `item/admin.py` to make it available in the Django admin interface.


You will need to set up an admin account using these commands : python manage.py createsuperuser. 
Follow the instructions on the terminal. Create a password. BOOM! You are now ready to Start creating the app.
